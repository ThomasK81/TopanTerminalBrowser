# TopanTerminalBrowser

Browse MeleteToPan generated theta.csv to explore Manhattan distances between passages of interest.

## Run the example

1. Clone the repo and open a terminal in the cloned folder.
2. On Mac or AMD-Linux run `./tbb`, on Windows run the win-exe, and if you have a 386-Linux system run the lin386-file (if you run it on a UNIX system you might have to chmod +x the executable before you can use it)
3. TTB reads in the theta.csv file that is in the same folder and presents the space generated by the topic model to you
4. Enter the identifier for the passage you are interested in (or hit enter to choose the suggested random passage)
5. Enter how many similar passages you want to generate.
6. Included in the sample is a LDAvis of the theta.csv used. You can open the `index.html` of [this folder] in your favourite browser to explore the topic model more thoroughly. Combine this approach with TBB to get the best experience.
7. Happy navigating!
